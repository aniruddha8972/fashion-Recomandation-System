# fashion-Recomandation-System

with the help of NLP and Deep Learning concept..

this is a Machine Learning based project using the concept of Deep Learning.

in this project we used Python Programing Language and the main Main module is Tencerflow for building the logic concept.
specially we use a KERAS sub module (keras.applications.resnet50)

@ -> RESNET50 
ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. 
You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database.
The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals.

Steps to achive this this work ....

Step -1 :

you have to download a collection of image file which is containing more of like 44,000 no of images of fashoin product...
you can download this link from the bellow link..
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset
or for small file you can also download..
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small?resource=download
after downloading you unzip it and save to your pc

Step -2:

Move the image file from what you have been unzipped..
and in this perticular file you have to move all three python files (app.py,main.py,test.py)..

Step-3:

first run the app.py file..
it takes some time (likely 45min - 1hr) to run..

step 4:

then eun the test.py file..

Step 5:

then run the Main.py file...
In this file file we used Streamlit module for getting a pre organized web page to run the whole program..

step 6:

now for testing ...collect a fashion product picture from google and drag ity on the page and run it and you can see 5 recomandation product...
